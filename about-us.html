          <strong>OPERATIONAL DETAILS</strong>
      <p><b>What is the Informal sector like at the OYSIRS?</b></p>
      <p>The Department is a novel idea that the Government inaugurated about four years ago in line with the current global trend of IGR generation. Its many activities have now been organized into a major revenue hub with a view to harnessing its huge but largely untapped revenue potentials.</p>
      <p>The tax-paying public in this category include, traders, vendors, artisans, commercial motor vehicle owners, craftsmen, dealers and all who are engaged in one form of micro self-employment or the other.</p>
       <p><b>How does the Informal sector contribute to the Oyo State Economy?</b></p>
       <p>Informal sector trading/businesses have always played an important role in that it has the potentials to create livelihood opportunities, contributes to alleviating poverty and serves as a buffer between employment and unemployment.</p>
        <p><b>What is the impact of the Informal Sector? </b></p>
        <p>There is a widespread assumption that the Informal economy contributes to sustainable growth.</p>
        <p>Generally speaking, the Informal sector is that part of an economy that was neither taxed nor monitored by the Government for quite a long time. All that have changed now as the State Government has taken keen interest in the sector with a view to developing its revenue streams and making its huge potential as an Internally Generated Revenue major earner a reality.</p>
        <p><b>Informal sector contributions in the last six months</b></p>
        <ul class="list-unstyled">
          <li><span class="fa fa-circle-arrow-right text-size-20 mx-3"></span>The Government had engaged the services of sub-revenue Consultants and also a Lead Consultant for the sector to mobilize more IGR</li>
          <li><span class="fa fa-circle-arrow-right text-size-20 mx-3"></span>The Consultants are to man different areas of collections such as daily road tax collection from commercial motorcycles, tricycles and motor vehicles, presumptive tax collection from traders, artisans and craftsmen etc.</li>
          <li><span class="fa fa-circle-arrow-right text-size-20 mx-3"></span>They are to get a database of the people working in this sector and ultimately bring them into the tax net.</li>
          <li><span class="fa fa-circle-arrow-right text-size-20 mx-3"></span>They are also to deploy cutting edge online/real time technologies in the collection process that ensures revenue leakages are blocked.</li>
          <li><span class="fa fa-circle-arrow-right text-size-20 mx-3"></span>A lot of stakeholders’ engagements have been done between the OYSIRS, the Consultants and different umbrella associations bodies of the targeted tax payers with a view to getting them to cooperate with Government and as well fulfill their civic obligations.</li>
          <li><span class="fa fa-circle-arrow-right text-size-20 mx-3"></span>The efforts are gradually yielding results. It is believed that once the right trajectory is continuously worked on, the revenue streams would soon start making an appreciable impact in large quantum and in a sustainable manner.</li>
          <br>
          <p><b>ADMINISTRATIVE DETAILS</b></p>
          <p>The department reports directly to the Executive Chairman. It does all the departmental tasks assigned by the Executive Chairman and collaborates with the consultants and other departments in any capacity required as directed by the Executive Chairman.</p>
